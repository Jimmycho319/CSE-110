My [README](/README) file!!

My favorite programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/) because... it is easy to work with!!

I am a current senior at UCSD and I enjoy back-end programming that makes use of creatively produced algorithms though I would pass on the math portion of it all :( Most of my pastime is spent hanging out with friends and reading. I hope to learn a lot about algorithms and theories for producing them through this course!



Some of the other languages that I know are:
- C++
- C
- Java

If I were to rank these languages for preferance..
1. Python
2. C
3. C++
4. Java

Languages I plan on learning:

- [x] C
- [x] C++
- [ ] C#
- [x] Java
- [ ] JavaScript
- [x] Python
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Rust
